# 👋 Hi there! I'm Cole Henderson

I took my first coding class to fulfill a college math credit. I was instantly hooked.

Ever since, my journey has led me through a variety of disciplines, industries, and interests, with a constant goal of growth.

### 🤔 What has that journey taught me?

My journey has taught me that I am driven by passion, curiosity, and quality; that careful planning is essential to good execution; and that by empowering colleagues I can accelerate the entire team’s value generation. It has also helped me realize my greatest strengths: organization, decisiveness, and communication.

### 👨‍💻 Additionally, it has let me showcase my skills through a variety of projects:

* **🤖 Built and scaled a company-wide ticket automation site, slashing my team’s hiring need in half**
* **💰 Led multiple cloud cost reduction efforts, reducing total AWS bills by double-digit percentiles in all instances**
* **🚀 Increased applications to my team by 10-fold through rigorous restructuring and reformatting of the underlying hiring process**
 
I specialize in Full Stack Development and Cloud Computing, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS). I am proficient in Python, Angular, Bash, JavaScript, and Groovy, as well as the DevOps framework, principally Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, and Linux — two lists I constantly working to strengthen and expand.

# 👋 Hi there! I'm Cole Henderson

I took my first coding class to fulfill a college math credit. I never looked back.

Ever since, my journey has led me through a variety of disciplines, industries, and interests, with a constant goal of growth.

### 🤔 What has that journey taught me?

I am driven by passion, curiosity, and quality; careful planning is essential to good execution; and empowering colleagues is the greatest value generator over time. It has also helped me realize my greatest strengths: organization, decisiveness, and communication.

### 👨‍💻 Additionally, it has let me showcase my skills through a variety of projects:

* **🤖 I built and scaled a company-wide ticket automation site, slashing my team’s hiring need in half**
* **💰 I led multiple cloud cost reduction efforts, reducing total AWS bills by double-digit percentiles in all instances**
* **🚀 I increased applications to my team by 10-fold through rigorous restructuring and reformatting of the underlying hiring process**
 
I specialize in Full Stack Development and Cloud Computing — specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS). I am proficient in Python, Angular, Bash, JavaScript, and Groovy, as well as the DevOps framework, most notably Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, and Linux — two lists I am constantly working to expand.
